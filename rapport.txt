preprocessing: we manually split th 400 pictures  data set into
40 for the online search phase and 360 for the offline database 
phase 

the work is segmented into files :

1- offline(offlin.py) : going through the 360 pictures and calculating the 2 histograms 
and concatenating them for each one as a descriptor , then saving the 
resulting matrix in a numpy array for the online use later on

2- online(recherche.py) : after loading the histograms array that was made earlier in 
the offline phase, we recive the request picture (in our case we loop through 
the 40 test set images after calulating thier 2 histograms and concatnating 
them similar to the offline phase)
and calculate the XÂ² distances between the new pic discriptor (aka th histogram) 
and the database ones , the shortest distance means the more similar they are

the running ordrs is recherche.py script after the offline.py one (obviously)

the recherche.py ends with a demonstration ovr the data bas similar to using KNN with K=1 
since it shows nams the picture in the database thats the closest to the request 
picture (due to not having labels on the pics so i had to check manually but the accuracy for it is pretty much 90%-100%)
